# Changelog

All notable changes to repowise are documented here.
This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-07

A large overhaul: faster indexing, smarter doc generation, transactional storage,
new analysis capabilities, and a completely revamped web UI that surfaces every
new signal — all without changing the eight MCP tool surface.

### Added

#### Pipeline & ingestion
- **Parallel indexing.** AST parsing now runs across all CPU cores via
  `ProcessPoolExecutor`. Graph construction and git history indexing run
  concurrently with `asyncio.gather`. Per-file git history fetched through a
  thread executor with a semaphore.
- **RAG-aware doc generation.** Pages are generated in topological order; each
  generation prompt now includes summaries of the file's direct dependencies,
  pulled from the vector store of already-generated pages.
- **Atomic three-store coordinator.** New `AtomicStorageCoordinator` buffers
  writes across SQL, the in-memory dependency graph, and the vector store, then
  flushes them as a single transaction. Failure in any store rolls back all three.
- **Dynamic import hint extractors.** The dependency graph now captures edges
  that pure AST parsing misses: Django `INSTALLED_APPS` / `ROOT_URLCONF` /
  `MIDDLEWARE`, pytest `conftest.py` fixture wiring, and Node/TS path aliases
  from `tsconfig.json` and `package.json` `exports`.

#### Analysis
- **Temporal hotspot decay.** New `temporal_hotspot_score` column on
  `git_metadata`, computed as `Σ exp(-ln2 · age_days / 180) · min(lines/100, 3)`
  per commit. Hotspot ranking now uses this score; commits from a year ago
  contribute ~25% as much as commits from today.
- **Percentile ranks via SQL window function.** `recompute_git_percentiles()`
  is now a single `PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY repo ORDER BY ...)` UPDATE
  instead of an in-Python sort. Faster and correct on large repos.
- **PR blast radius analyzer.** New `PRBlastRadiusAnalyzer` returns direct
  risks, transitive affected files, co-change warnings, recommended reviewers,
  test gaps, and an overall 0–10 risk score. Surfaced via `get_risk(changed_files=...)`
  and a new web page.
- **Security pattern scanner.** Indexing now runs `SecurityScanner` over each
  file. Findings (eval/exec, weak crypto, raw SQL string construction,
  hardcoded secrets, `pickle.loads`, etc.) are stored in a new
  `security_findings` table.
- **Knowledge map.** Top owners, "bus factor 1" knowledge silos (>80% single
  owner), and high-centrality "onboarding targets" with thin documentation —
  surfaced in `get_overview` and the web overview page.

#### LLM cost tracking
- New `llm_costs` table records every LLM call (model, tokens, USD cost).
- `CostTracker` aggregates session totals; pricing covers Claude 4.6 family,
  GPT-4.1 family, and Gemini.
- New `repowise costs` CLI: `--since`, `--by operation|model|day`.
- Indexing progress bar shows a live `Cost: $X.XXXX` counter.

#### MCP tool enhancements (still 8 tools — strictly more capable)
- `get_risk(targets, changed_files=None)` — when `changed_files` is provided,
  returns the full PR blast-radius report (transitive affected, co-change
  warnings, recommended reviewers, test gaps, overall 0–10 score). Per-file
  responses now include `test_gap: bool` and `security_signals: list`.
- `get_overview()` — now includes a `knowledge_map` block (top owners, silos,
  onboarding targets).
- `get_dead_code(min_confidence?, include_internals?, include_zombie_packages?)` —
  sensitivity controls for false positives in framework-heavy code.

#### REST endpoints (new)
- `GET /api/repos/{id}/costs` and `/costs/summary` — grouped LLM spend.
- `GET /api/repos/{id}/security` — security findings, filterable by file/severity.
- `POST /api/repos/{id}/blast-radius` — PR impact analysis.
- `GET /api/repos/{id}/knowledge-map` — owners / silos / onboarding targets.
- `GET /api/repos/{id}/health/coordinator` — three-store drift status.
- `GET /api/repos/{id}/hotspots` now returns `temporal_hotspot_score` and is
  ordered by it.
- `GET /api/repos/{id}/git-metadata` now returns `test_gap`.
- Job SSE stream now emits `actual_cost_usd` (running cost since job start).

#### Web UI (new pages and components)
- **Costs page** — daily bar chart, grouped tables by operation/model/day.
- **Blast Radius page** — paste files (or click hotspot suggestion chips) to
  see risk gauge, transitive impact, co-change warnings, reviewers, test gaps.
- **Knowledge Map card** on the overview dashboard.
- **Trend column** on the hotspots table with flame indicator (default sort).
- **Security Panel** in the wiki page right sidebar.
- **"No tests" badge** on wiki pages with no detected test file.
- **System Health card** on the settings page (SQL / Vector / Graph counts +
  drift % + status).
- **Live cost indicator** on the generation progress bar.

#### CLI
- `repowise costs [--since DATE] [--by operation|model|day]` — new command.
- `repowise dead-code` — new flags `--min-confidence`, `--include-internals`,
  `--include-zombie-packages`, `--no-unreachable`, `--no-unused-exports`.
- `repowise doctor` — new Check #10 reports coordinator drift across all
  three stores. `--repair` deletes orphaned vectors and rebuilds missing graph
  nodes from SQL.

### Fixed
- C++ dependency resolution edge cases.
- Decision extraction timeout on very large histories.
- Resume / progress bar visibility for oversized files.
- Coordinator `health_check` falsely reporting 100% drift on LanceDB / Pg
  vector stores (was returning -1 for the count). Now uses `list_page_ids()`.
- Coordinator `health_check` returning `null` graph node count when no
  in-memory `GraphBuilder` is supplied. Now falls back to SQL `COUNT(*)`.

### Internal
- Three new Alembic migrations: `0009_llm_costs`, `0010_temporal_hotspot_score`,
  `0011_security_findings`.
- New module: `packages/core/.../persistence/coordinator.py`
- New module: `packages/core/.../ingestion/dynamic_hints/` (5 files)
- New module: `packages/core/.../analysis/pr_blast.py`
- New module: `packages/core/.../analysis/security_scan.py`
- New module: `packages/core/.../generation/cost_tracker.py`
- New module: `packages/server/.../services/knowledge_map.py`

### Compatibility
- Existing repositories must run migrations: `repowise doctor` will detect
  the missing tables and prompt; alternatively re-run `repowise init` to
  rebuild from scratch.
- The eight MCP tool names and signatures are backwards compatible — new
  parameters are all optional.
