</div>

Your AI coding agent reads files. It does not know who owns them, which ones change together, which ones are dead, or why they were built the way they were. It has the source code and zero institutional knowledge.

repowise fixes that. It indexes your codebase into four intelligence layers — dependency graph, git history, auto-generated documentation, and architectural decisions — and exposes them to Claude Code (and any MCP-compatible AI agent) through ten precisely designed tools. **27× fewer tokens per query. 36% cheaper. Same answer quality.**

The result: your agent answers *"why does auth work this way?"* instead of *"here is what auth.ts contains."*

## 🏆 Benchmarked against frontier LLMs

> **[repowise-bench →](https://github.com/repowise-dev/repowise-bench)** — an open SWE-QA benchmark that grades how well standard LLMs answer real software-engineering questions over real repositories.
>
> On 48 paired tasks from `pallets/flask` (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, end-to-end), repowise-augmented Claude Code matches baseline answer quality while being dramatically leaner:
>
> | Metric (per task, mean) | Baseline | **+ repowise** | Δ |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | 💰 Cost | $0.1396 | **$0.0890** | **−36 %** |
> | ⚡ Wall time | 41.7 s | **33.9 s** | **−19 %** |
> | 🛠️ Tool calls | 7.4 | **3.8** | **−49 %** |
> | 📄 Files read | 1.9 | **0.2** | **−89 %** |
>
> **32 / 48 (67 %)** tasks are cheaper with repowise — at parity quality (judge Δ ≈ −0.01).

### Token efficiency — because context windows aren't free

There's a small genre of "token efficiency" benchmarks going around. It would be impolite not to contribute one. Ours runs on the 30 most recent non-merge commits of `pallets/flask` and asks one question: *to understand a commit, how many tokens does each strategy ask the model to read?*

| Strategy | Tokens / commit |
|---|---|
| Naive (full contents of changed files) | 64,039 |
| `git diff` only | 14,888 |
| **`repowise get_context`** | **2,391** |

**209× less than naive (mean), 26.8× pooled, 1,214× best case. 41.7× less than git diff (mean), 6.2× pooled.** Same file list, same tokenizer (`cl100k_base`), no per-strategy fudge. We report mean, pooled, and median together because picking just one would be the kind of thing other people in this genre seem to do.

## What repowise builds

repowise runs once, builds everything, then keeps it in sync on every commit.

### ◈ Graph Intelligence
tree-sitter parses every file into symbols. NetworkX builds a dependency graph — files, classes, functions, imports, inheritance, and call relationships. PageRank identifies your most central code. Community detection finds logical modules even when your directory structure doesn't reflect them.

### ◈ Git Intelligence
500 commits of history turned into signals: hotspot files (high churn × high complexity), ownership percentages per engineer, co-change pairs (files that change together without an import link — hidden coupling), and significant commit messages that explain *why* code evolved.

### ◈ Documentation Intelligence
An LLM-generated wiki for every module and file, rebuilt incrementally on every commit. Coverage tracking. Freshness scoring per page. Semantic search via RAG. Confidence scores show how current each page is relative to the underlying code.

### ◈ Decision Intelligence
The layer nobody else has. Architectural decisions captured from git history, inline markers, and explicit CLI — linked to the graph nodes they govern, tracked for staleness as code evolves.

```python
# WHY: JWT chosen over sessions — API must be stateless for k8s horizontal scaling
# DECISION: All external API calls wrapped in CircuitBreaker after payment provider outages
# TRADEOFF: Accepted eventual consistency in preferences for write throughput
```

These become structured decision records, queryable by Claude Code via `get_why()`.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install repowise
```

```bash
cd your-project
repowise init        # builds all four intelligence layers (~25 min first time)
repowise serve       # starts MCP server + local dashboard
```

Add to your Claude Code config (optional, `repowise init` already initializes `.mcp.json` under the project root):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repowise": {
      "command": "repowise",
      "args": ["mcp", "/path/to/your/project"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note on init time:** Initial indexing analyzes your entire codebase — AST parsing, 500-commit git history, LLM doc generation, embedding indexing, and decision archaeology. This is a one-time cost (~25 minutes for a 3,000-file project). Every subsequent update after a commit takes under 30 seconds.

---

## Ten MCP tools

Most tools are designed around data entities — one module, one file, one symbol — which forces AI agents into long chains of sequential calls. repowise tools are designed around **tasks**. Pass multiple targets in one call. Get complete context back.

| Tool | What it answers | When Claude Code calls it |
|---|---|---|
| `get_answer(question)` | One-call RAG: retrieves over the wiki, gates on confidence, and synthesizes a cited 2–5 sentence answer. High-confidence answers cite directly; ambiguous queries return ranked excerpts. Responses are cached per repository by question hash. | First call on any code question — collapses search → read → reason into one round-trip |
| `get_symbol(symbol_id)` | Resolves a qualified symbol id (`path::Class::method`) to its source body, signature, and docstring | When the question names a specific class, function, or method |
| `get_overview()` | Architecture summary, module map, entry points | First call on any unfamiliar codebase |
| `get_context(targets, include?, compact?)` | Docs, ownership, decisions, freshness for any targets — files, modules, or symbols. `compact=True` is the default and bounds the response to ~10K characters; pass `compact=False` for the full structure block, importer list, and per-symbol docstrings | Before reading or modifying code. Pass all relevant targets in one call. |
| `get_risk(targets?, changed_files?)` | Hotspot scores, dependents, co-change partners, blast radius, recommended reviewers, test gaps, security signals, 0–10 risk score | Before modifying files — understand what could break |
| `get_why(query?)` | Three modes: NL search over decisions · path-based decisions for a file · no-arg health dashboard | Before architectural changes — understand existing intent |
| `search_codebase(query)` | Semantic search over the full wiki. Natural language. | When `get_answer` returned low confidence and you need to discover candidate pages by topic |
| `get_dependency_path(from, to)` | Connection path between two files, modules, or symbols | When tracing how two things are connected |
| `get_dead_code(min_confidence?, include_internals?, include_zombie_packages?)` | Unreachable code sorted by confidence and cleanup impact | Cleanup tasks |
| `get_architecture_diagram(module?)` | Mermaid diagram for the repo or a specific module | Documentation and presentation |

### Tool call comparison — a real task

*"Add rate limiting to all API endpoints."*

| Approach | Tool calls | Time to first change | What it misses |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code alone (no MCP) | grep + read ~30 files | ~8 min | Ownership, prior decisions, hidden coupling |
| **repowise (10 tools)** | **5 calls** | **~2 min** | **Nothing** |

The 5 calls for that task:

```python
get_overview()                                         # orient: understand the architecture
get_context(["middleware", "api/routes", "payments"])  # understand 3 modules at once
get_risk(["middleware/auth.ts"])                       # assess: 47 dependents, co-changes
get_why("rate limiting")                               # check: any prior decision?
search_codebase("rate limit OR throttle OR retry")     # find: any prior implementation?
```

---

## How Claude Code uses it

```
User: Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints

Claude Code:
→ get_overview()
  "Express API. Entry points in api/routes/. Middleware in middleware/."

→ get_context(["middleware", "api/routes", "payments"])
  middleware/: existing chain is cors → auth → routes. Owner: @alex.
  api/routes/: 23 route files. No existing rate limiting.
  payments/: Owner @sarah (71%). Decision: all side effects must be idempotent.

→ get_why("rate limiting")
  "No prior decision found. No prior implementation detected."

→ get_risk(["middleware/auth.ts"])
  "47 files import this. Co-changes with all 4 service listeners.
   Risk summary: any interface change here touches 47 dependents."

→ search_codebase("rate limit throttle retry")
  "Found: payments/retry.ts already has RetryQueue class.
   Found: payments/middleware.ts has idempotency key middleware."

Implementing rate-limiting middleware, inserting after cors, before auth.
Will also update tests/middleware.test.ts — detected as historical co-change partner.
Flagging payments/ for @sarah review — hotspot, high ownership concentration.
```

This is what happens when an AI agent has real codebase intelligence.

## Auto-generated CLAUDE.md

After every `repowise init` and `repowise update`, repowise regenerates your `CLAUDE.md` from actual codebase intelligence — not a template. No LLM calls. Under 5 seconds.

```bash
repowise generate-claude-md
```

The generated section includes: architecture summary, module map, hotspot warnings, ownership map, hidden coupling pairs, active architectural decisions, and dead code candidates. A user-owned section at the top is never touched.

```markdown
<!-- REPOWISE:START — managed automatically, do not edit -->
## Architecture
Monorepo with 4 packages. Entry points: api/server.ts, cli/index.ts.

## Hotspots — handle with care
- payments/processor.ts — 47 commits/month, high complexity, primary owner: @sarah
- shared/events/EventBus.ts — 23 dependents, co-changes with all service listeners

## Active architectural decisions
- JWT over sessions (auth/service.ts) — stateless required for k8s horizontal scaling
- CircuitBreaker on all external calls — after payment provider outages in Q3 2024

## Hidden coupling (no import link, but change together)
- auth.ts ↔ middleware/session.ts — co-changed 31 times in last 500 commits
<!-- REPOWISE:END -->
```

---

## Git intelligence

repowise mines your last 500 commits (configurable) to produce signals no static analysis can find.

**Hotspots** — files in the top 25% of both churn and complexity. These are where bugs live. Flagged in the dashboard, in CLAUDE.md, and surfaced by `get_risk()` before Claude Code touches them.

**Ownership** — `git blame` aggregated into ownership percentages per engineer. Know who to ping. Know where knowledge silos exist.

**Co-change pairs** — files that change together in the same commit without an import link. Hidden coupling that AST parsing cannot detect. `get_context()` surfaces co-change partners alongside direct dependencies.

**Bus factor** — files owned >80% by a single engineer. Shown in the ownership view. Surfaced in CLAUDE.md as knowledge risk.

**Significant commits** — the last 10 meaningful commit messages per file (filtered: no merges, no dependency bumps, no lint) are included in generation prompts. The LLM explains *why* code is structured the way it is.

---

## Dead code detection

Pure graph traversal and SQL. No LLM calls. Completes in under 10 seconds for any repo size.

```
repowise dead-code

  23 findings · 4 safe to delete

  ✓ utils/legacy_parser.ts          file      1.00   safe to delete
  ✓ auth/session.ts                 file      0.92   safe to delete
  ✓ helpers/formatDate              export    0.71   safe to delete
  ✓ types/OldUser                   export    0.68   safe to delete
  ✗ analytics/v1/tracker.ts         file      0.41   recent activity — review first
```

Conservative by design. `safe_to_delete` requires confidence ≥ 0.70 and excludes dynamically-loaded patterns (`*Plugin`, `*Handler`, `*Adapter`, `*Middleware`). repowise surfaces candidates. Engineers decide.

---

## Architectural decisions

```bash
repowise decision add              # guided interactive capture (~90 seconds)
repowise decision confirm          # review auto-proposed decisions from git history
repowise decision health           # stale, conflicting, ungoverned hotspots
```

```
repowise decision health

  2 stale decisions
    → "JWT over sessions" — auth/service.ts rewritten 3 months ago, decision may be outdated
    → "EventBus in-process only" — 8 of 14 governed files changed since recorded

  1 conflict
    → payments/: two decisions with overlapping scope and contradictory rationale

  1 ungoverned hotspot
    → payments/processor.ts — 47 commits/month, no architectural decisions recorded
```

Decisions are linked to graph nodes, tracked for staleness as code evolves, and surfaced by `get_why()` whenever Claude Code touches governed files.

When a senior engineer leaves, the "why" usually leaves with them. Decision intelligence keeps it in the codebase.

**The honest summary:**

- **vs Google Code Wiki** — Google's offering (launched Nov 2025) is cloud-only with no private repo support yet. Gemini-powered docs are strong, but there's no git behavioral intelligence, no dead code detection, no MCP server, and no architectural decisions.
- **vs DeepWiki** — Cloud-only, closed source (community self-hostable forks exist). Strong docs and Q&A, with a basic 3-tool MCP server. No git analytics, no dead code, no decisions.
- **vs Swimm** — Swimm's strength is keeping manually-written docs linked to code snippets with staleness detection. No graph, no git behavioral analytics, no dead code, no MCP by default. Enterprise pricing for private hosting.
- **vs CodeScene** — CodeScene has excellent git intelligence (hotspots, co-changes, ownership, bus factor). No documentation generation, no RAG, no architectural decisions. Closed source, per-author pricing.

repowise is the intersection: CodeScene-level git intelligence + auto-generated documentation + agent-native MCP + architectural decisions, self-hostable and open source.

## Hosted version — for teams

For teams that want repowise managed, we offer a hosted version. No self-hosting, no infrastructure to maintain — we handle deployment, updates, and webhooks. If your team wants shared codebase intelligence without the operational overhead, reach out.

Hosted adds what only makes sense in a managed, multi-user environment:

- **Shared team context layer** — one CLAUDE.md backed by the full graph and decision layer, auto-injected into every team member's Claude Code session via MCP
- **Session intelligence harvesting** — architectural decisions extracted from AI coding sessions and proposed to the team knowledge base automatically
- **Security vulnerability reporting** — repowise scans for known vulnerability patterns, dependency risks, and security anti-patterns across your codebase and surfaces them proactively. Not just `eval` calls — real CVE-aware analysis
- **Engineering leader dashboard** — bus factor trends, hotspot evolution over time, cross-repo dead code, ownership drift
- **Managed webhooks** — zero-configuration auto re-index on every commit to any branch
- **Integrations** — Slack alerts, Jira and Linear decision linking, Confluence and Notion doc sync, GitHub and GitLab webhooks, PagerDuty escalation routing
- **Cross-repo intelligence** — hotspots, dead code, and ownership across all your repositories at once

## Supported languages

**Code:** Python · TypeScript · JavaScript · Go · Rust · Java · C · C++ · Ruby · Kotlin

**Config / contracts:** OpenAPI · Protobuf · GraphQL · Dockerfile · GitHub Actions YAML · Makefile

More languages coming soon — Swift, Scala, PHP, Dart, and Elixir are on the roadmap.

Adding a new language requires one `.scm` tree-sitter query file and one config entry. No changes to the parser. PRs welcome. See [Adding a new language](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-language).

---

## Privacy

**Self-hosted:** Your code never leaves your infrastructure. No telemetry. No analytics. Zero.

**BYOK:** Bring your own Anthropic or OpenAI API key. We never see your LLM calls. Zero data retention via Anthropic's API policy — your code is never used to train any model.

**What is stored:** NetworkX graph (file and symbol relationships), LanceDB embeddings (non-reversible vectors), generated wiki pages, git metadata. Raw source code is processed transiently and never persisted.

**Fully offline:** Ollama for LLM + local embedding models = zero external API calls.

---

## Configuration

`repowise init` generates `.repowise/config.yaml`. Key options:

```yaml
provider: anthropic               # anthropic | openai | ollama | litellm
